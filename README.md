# day04_homework
This is the weekend project of week one where we are creating a site.

To navigate between the first page and my second page I've added a few links.
-To navigate to the home page, click on the skinny ties logo within the header. 
-To navigate to my second page, locations.html, scroll to the bottom and click on the link in the footer nav which says "Where to Buy"
